# SteamMultiAccount
An app to simplify managing of multiple steam accounts. It stores usernames and passwords for you and automatically enters them in steams login form to **make logging in faster and less of a hassle**.

All stored **passwords are encrypted** with a master password that you have to enter each time you start the application. There are no restrictions to what passwords are allowed as master, but of course it is recommended to use a strong password.

# How to use

1. Download the "published" folder and execute the "setup.exe" to install the application. Then doubleclick the new icon on your desktop to start it. 

2. SteamMultiAccount will first ask you for a master password which will then be used to savely store the steam account data you add to the program. As soon as you added a steam account, it will be available in the quickstart interface.

3. Now if you want to login to any of your added steam accounts just start SteamMultiAccount, enter the master password and click the button for the account you want to use or use the number keys to select an account.

Note that there is no way to retrieve your username/password combinations from the data SteamMultiAccount stores. This app is no replacement for remembering your login data.
